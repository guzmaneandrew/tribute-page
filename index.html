            <h3>Here's a timeline of The Notorious B.I.G.'s life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="year">1972:</span> Wallace was born in the Brooklyn borough of New York
                    City on
                    May 21,
                    1972, the only child of Jamaican immigrant parents.</li>
                <li><span class="year">1972–1991:</span> He began rapping as a teenager, entertaining people
                    on
                    the
                    streets, and performed with local groups. In his adolescent years, he became more
                    involved
                    in crime.
                    In 1991, Wallace was arrested for dealing crack cocaine and spent nine months in jail.
                </li>
                <li><span class="year">1991–1994:</span> Sean "Puffy" Combs signed Wallace to Uptown after hearing his
                    demo
                    tape in
                    1992. A year later, Puffy was fired from Uptown and launched Bad Boy Records, instantly
                    Wallace's
                    new label. On August 8, 1993, Wallace's first child, T'yanna was born. Although he
                    continued
                    dealing
                    drugs, Combs discovered that and obliged him to quit.</li>
                <li><span class="year">1994:</span> Wallace had his first pop chart success as a solo artist
                    with double
                    A-side, "Juicy / Unbelievable". Ready to Die was released on September 13, 1994 and
                    reached
                    No. 13
                    on the Billboard 200 chart. Around the time of the album's release, Wallace became
                    friends
                    with
                    fellow rapper Tupac Shakur. </li>
                <li><span class="year">1995:</span> In August 1995, Wallace's protégé group, Junior
                    M.A.F.I.A.,
                    released
                    their debut album Conspiracy. The record went Gold and its singles, "Player's Anthem"
                    and
                    "Get
                    Money", both featuring Wallace, went Gold and Platinum. Wallace continued to work with
                    R&B
                    artists,
                    by the end of the year, he was the top-selling male solo artist and rapper on the U.S.
                    pop
                    and R&B
                    charts. In his year of success, Wallace became involved in a rivalry between the East
                    and
                    West Coast
                    hip hop scenes with Shakur, now his former friend. </li>
                <li><span class="year">1996:</span> Wallace worked with pop singer Michael Jackson on the
                    album
                    HIStory.
                    On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot multiple times in a drive-by shooting and died.
                    Rumors
                    of
                    Wallace's involvement with Shakur's murder spread. On October 29, 1996, Faith Evans gave
                    birth to
                    Wallace's son, Christopher "C.J." Wallace Jr.</li>
                <li><span class="year">1997:</span> During the recording for his second album, Life After
                    Death,
                    Wallace
                    and Lil' Cease were in a car accident. Despite his hospitalization, he continued to work
                    on
                    the
                    album. On March 9, 1997, Wallace was returning to his hotel after a party and was shot
                    to
                    death.
